/* 
In programming, an object is a structure of code 
that models a real-life object. You can have a simple object that represents
a box and contains information about its width, length, and height, or you 
could have an object that represents a person,
 and contains data about their name, height, weight, 
what language they speak, how to say hello to them, and more.
