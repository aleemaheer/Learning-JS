### Notes for Object Oriented Programming
###### There are four pillars of object oriented programming, which are:
* Encapsulation: Reduce complexity + increase reuseability
* Abstraction : Reduce complexity + isolate impact of changes
* Inheritence : Eliminate reduntant code
* Polymorphism : Refactor ugly switch/case statements
